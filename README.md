# S/TEST
Welcome to the official GitHub page for S/TEST.

# What is S/TEST?
S/TEST is an image service (no hosting for your images, silly) where its main way to be used is a discord command named s/

# How do i use the s/ command?
The command is simply just an edit command for you computer nerds (like me), you send a message and you use s/[message you just sent]/[what you want it to change to.]

# Donate to me!
This is a solo project and i am using replit.com to even use it!
A donation would be great!
